		<h1>Hi. I'm Christopher</h1>
		<p>Here is my <a href="cnvazquez.com/blog">Blog</a></p>
		<p>I'm just a guy experiencing the world. Or worlds, depending on if great fiction counts in your book. It definitely counts in mine - it's my way of being able to experience way more than I could in just my lifetime</p>
